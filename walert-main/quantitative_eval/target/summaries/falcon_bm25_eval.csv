Then, in the third year of the SE degree, students spend a whole year (roughly 40 working weeks) in an industry placement. They work in a software firm engaging in all facets of software development process, from design to deployment. Final year (third in CS and fourth in SE) are slightly different, in that, SE students will do another large in-house project and more SE electives, while CS students will do a slightly smaller project and a few more core courses and electives.\nDocument 4: RMIT provides pathways for students excel in one program to transfer into another program, as long as they meet certain criteria. For example, if you enrol in IT program, maintain above Distinction-level average, AND specifically do a Discrete Structures course in their first year, they may apply to transfer into CS program after completing a full year. This is not a guaranteed path, however, you have the control. If you do extremely well in your first year (even if you do not have VCE Maths Methods), you have a good chance that you transferred into CS program after one year.\nDocument 5: No. you won’t get full credit, you will get credit for the common courses between these two programs. We have a pathway study plan for such students. Roughly speaking you can get credit for 75% of the courses you do in first year IT.\nAnswer: ""Yes, there are a variety of options available for selecting elective courses.

Innovation sectors and IT-support roles in smaller companies often remain local. In 2021's first half, there were 91,000 IT job advertisements.\nDocument 3: That’s a myth. Yes, some low-end jobs were outsourced such as call centres, however, there is a growing IT industry, especially, within startups, innovative IT technologies, such as home automation, Internet of things, machine learning, etc, which are not, and will not be, outsourced and Melbourne is always at the forefront of these developments. Also, IT-support jobs, in small to medium scale companies, will still remain locally. There were 91000 job adverts in the first half of 2021 alone. 530,000 (more than half a million, out of a workforce of 16.5 million) work in IT sector. What really matters is that job demand in IT sector is growing, for last 11 years (since 2007-08 downturn) and never looked back since 2007-08.

We do have a lot of industry contacts, as well as a full-time industry coordinator who will assist students to establish industry links. In addition, towards the second part of second year, we run a number of professional development activities to assist students to get themselves prepared for applying industry placements. In the worst comes to worst, we will transfer SE students to CS program if -- after every possible avenue is exhausted -- they cannot secure an industry placement.\nDocument 5: There's a multitude of Work-Integrated Learning components available at RMIT. Some are mandatory, while others are optional. As a Software Engineering student or a student of any professional degree, you're required to complete a year of industry placement and a final year project. All RMIT students must complete a capstone project in their final year, working closely with an industry partner or in a simulated industry scenario, guided by a project supervisor. Plus, every year, we offer summer projects and industry events such as the ANZ hackathon, AIIA iAwards competition, and various coding and security competitions.\nAnswer: <noinput>""}]","'Yes, the gaming industry and digital media have a bright future in Australia, and there are still plenty of opportunities for Australian professionals in these fields.'","""Yes, the future prospects for careers in the gaming industry, and in a larger context, digital media, are very promising.""","""Yes, the future prospects for careers in the gaming industry, and in a larger context, digital media, are very promising.""",False,False,False,"'Yes, the gaming industry and digital media have a bright future in Australia, and there are still plenty of opportunities for Australian professionals in these fields.'","""Yes, the future prospects for careers in the gaming industry, and in a larger context, digital media, are very promising.""","""Yes, the future prospects for careers in the gaming industry, and in a larger context, digital media, are very promising.""","That’s a myth.
