No matter what degree you do, do really well and you find jobs.\nDocument 3: There isn\'t a specific double degree, but we do have a selection of cross-disciplinary majors and minors, with a few emphasising business. BIT students have the greatest choice.\nDocument 4: RMIT offers the chance for students to switch programs based on specific criteria. Notably, IT students with above Distinction-level grades and a completed Discrete Structures course may apply for a CS transfer. It\'s not assured but is performance-dependent.\nDocument 5: RMIT degrees are quite specific in the discipline area, for example, our degrees are titled Bachelor of Computer Science, Bachelor of Software Engineering, Bachelor of Information Technology, and Bachelor of Data Science. In addition to the above, we offer an honours degree option: a one-year Honours degree which is only be started after completing a regular three year CS degree. It is called Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours). This is not available for Year 12 entry students. We used to offer a Deans Scholar degree, however, it is not offered in 2023.\nAnswer: ""Yes, there are double degrees available in CS at RMIT.
