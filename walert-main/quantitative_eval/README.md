Demo Video Link: https://bit.ly/chiir24walertdemovideo

## About Walert
Walert is a conversational agent designed to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) regarding programs of study offered at the School of Computing Technologies, RMIT University. Our intent-based approach, deployed on Amazon Echo devices, was showcased as a live demo during RMIT University's Open Day in August 2023.


Note: This repository contains all utility code for 'Behind The Scenes' of Walert.


## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- If using Mac M2, you will need this hack to install `nmslib`: [https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib/issues/535](https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib/issues/535)
- Install all packages in `requirements.txt` using:
```

	cd walert/quantitative_eval
	pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## data 
All dataset files are located in the `data` folder, which includes extracted queries and passages from FAQ documents. The folder provides detailed descriptions for each required file, along with its format. To run the models on a new dataset, ensure that it is structured exactly as it is in the `data` folder.

## src
This directory contains all the source codes necessary for indexing, retrieving, and searching using `(BM25 + Falcon)` and `(DPR + Falcon)` approaches.

## target
The `target` directory includes all the output generated by the source codes for the RAG  model using both `(BM25 + Falcon)` and `(DPR + Falcon)` approaches.
